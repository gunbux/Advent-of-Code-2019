# Advent-of-Code-2019
First attempt at Advent of Code.

Was pretty challenging, but really fun to do, and I look forward to AOC 2020. Puzzles were well made and very well thought out. 

<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
<ul>Reusability of code. I ended up skipping all the Intcode questions since my Intcode implementation was extremely sloppy and not very readable or reusable. This goes for the rest of the code in the first few days. Eventually, I made sure to make my code a lot of readable.</ul>
<ul>Knowledge of Algorithms. The later days require use of algorithms such as DFS and BFS which I was not familiar with, or knew how to implement in Python.</ul>
<ul>Time and Space complexity. Many, many of my solutions took way longer than needed to get the correct solution, with fairly large time complexity in many, and space complexity (memory error) in one of the days (Day 16 Part 2), which could have been avoided if I had planned my implementations beforehand. But all in all, it was a big factor that I didn't really put much thought into.</ul>
<ul>Speed. I was never planning to try for the leaderboard, but even still, looking at others complete the Day's problems in under 5 minutes while I struggled to do so in 3 hours, really showed how my speed compares to others. Towards the end of AOC it did improve quite a bit though. Practice makes perfect.</ul>
